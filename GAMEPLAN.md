# pixels.earth

- The entire earths maps is a pixel grid of 2^19 x 2^19 pixels, that's 524,288 x 524,288 = 274,625,296 pixels total.
- The entire map is divided into 128x128 pixel shards, so there are 4096 x 4096 = 16,777,216 total shards.
- Every shard is an account on solana (8kb per shard = roughly 0.05 SOL cost)
- Unlocking a shard means the user paid and initialized the account, and they now own the shard. (account init fee that goes to the network + a fractional platform fee that goes to the smart contract)
- The shards are basically users territory, they can draw whatever they want on it freely without any limits
- Everytime someone else places pixels on your territory, you recieve tokens (1 token / 10 pixels placed)
- When drawing on other peoples shards, there is a cool down of 30 seconds after every 100 pixels placed
- Players can bypass this cooldown by paying a small fee to the shard owner (either in SOL or in tokens received)
- After paying fees, there will be no cooldown for 3 hours
- Dead shards: shards without activity can be reclaimed by other active users for free or with a much cheaper fee than a new shard
- Functionality to upload an image and the app converts it into pixels and places them on the map (premium feature?)
- You might have drawn something super cool on your shard (territory), but someone else starts drawing on it, to mess it up. You will have to defend your art by restoring it and undoing the mess. You will receive notifications when someone draws on your territory
- You earn xp for placing pixels on other peoples territories
